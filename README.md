## Preview

In our dashboard we show data analysis and log prediction table. Data analysis consists of two components: 
the counters of processed logs and the chart which describes the state of normal logs VS. attacks.

In the following figure there is the final output of our project, which is each log record added to the log file, its url, predicted Attack, 
description, and return code will be displayed in the table so the admin can track system logs easily with their prediction.
